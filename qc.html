				A quantum computer harnesses some of the almost-mystical phenomena of quantum 
				mechanics to deliver huge leaps forward in processing power. Quantum machines 
				promise to outstrip even the most capable of today’s—and tomorrow’s—supercomputers.
				<br>The secret to a quantum computer’s power lies in its ability to generate and 
				manipulate quantum bits, or qubits.

			<p class='info-content'>
				They won’t wipe out conventional computers. Using a classical machine 
				will still be the easiest and most economical solution for tackling most problems. 
				But quantum computers promise to power exciting advances in various fields, from 
				materials science to pharmaceuticals research. Companies are already experimenting 
				with them to develop things like lighter and more powerful batteries for electric 
				cars, and to help create novel drugs.

			<h1 class='info-heading'> How does Quantum Computers work? </h1> 
			<p class='info-content'>
				Generating and managing qubits is a scientific and engineering challenge. Some 
				companies, such as IBM, Google, and Rigetti Computing, use superconducting 
				circuits cooled to temperatures colder than deep space. Others, like IonQ, trap 
				individual atoms in electromagnetic fields on a silicon chip in ultra-high-vacuum 
				chambers. In both cases, the goal is to isolate the qubits in a controlled quantum 
				state.<br>Qubits have some quirky quantum properties that mean a connected group 
				of them can provide way more processing power than the same number of binary bits. 
				One of those properties is known as superposition and another	is called entanglement.
			</p>
			<p class='info-content'>
				To put qubits into superposition, researchers manipulate them using precision 
				lasers or microwave beams.<br>Thanks to this counterintuitive phenomenon, a 
				quantum computer with several qubits in superposition can crunch through a vast 
				number of potential outcomes simultaneously. The final result of a calculation 
				emerges only once the qubits are measured, which immediately causes their quantum 
				state to “collapse” to either 1 or 0.
			</p>
			<p class='info-content'>
				Quantum Computers also use the phenomenon of entanglement.Quantum computers harness 
				entangled qubits in a kind of quantum daisy chain to work their magic. The machines’ 
				ability to speed up calculations using specially designed quantum algorithms is 
				why there’s so much buzz about their potential.<br>That’s the good news. The bad 
				news is that quantum machines are way more error-prone than classical computers 
				because of decoherence. 
			</p>
			<p class='info-content'>
				The slightest vibration or change in temperature—disturbances known as “noise” 
				in quantum-speak—can cause them to tumble out of superposition before their job 
				has been properly done. That’s why researchers do their best to protect qubits 
				from the outside world in those supercooled fridges and vacuum chambers.<br>Despite 
				their efforts, noise still causes lots of errors to creep into calculations.Smart 
				quantum algorithms can compensate for some of these, and adding more qubits also 
				helps. However, it will likely take thousands of standard qubits to create a single, 
				highly reliable one, known as a “logical” qubit. This will sap a lot of a quantum 
				computer’s computational capacity.

			<h1 class='info-heading'> What is Quantum Supermacy? </h1> 
			<p class='info-content'>
				It’s the point at which a quantum computer can complete a mathematical calculation 
				that is demonstrably beyond the reach of even the most powerful supercomputer.<br>
				It’s still unclear exactly how many qubits will be needed to achieve this because 
				researchers keep finding new algorithms to boost the performance of classical 
				machines, and supercomputing hardware keeps getting better. But researchers and 
				companies are working hard to claim the title, running tests against some of the 
				world’s most powerful supercomputers.

			<h1 class='info-heading'> Some Applications of Quantum Computing </h1> 
			<p class='info-content'>
				One of the most promising applications of quantum computers is for simulating 
				the behavior of matter down to the molecular level. Auto manufacturers like 
				Volkswagen and Daimler are using quantum computers to simulate the chemical 
				composition of electrical-vehicle batteries to help find new ways to improve 
				their performance. And pharmaceutical companies are leveraging them to analyze 
				and compare compounds that could lead to the creation of new drugs.<br><br>The 
				machines are also great for optimization problems because they can crunch through 
				vast numbers of potential solutions extremely fast. Airbus, for instance, is using 
				them to help calculate the most fuel-efficient ascent and descent paths for aircraft. 
				And Volkswagen has unveiled a service that calculates the optimal routes for buses 
				and taxis in cities in order to minimize congestion. Some researchers also think 
				the machines could be used to accelerate artificial intelligence.
