			<p class='info-content'>
				Artificial intelligence (AI) is wide-ranging branch of computer science 
				concerned with building smart machines capable of performing tasks that 
				typically require human intelligence. AI is an interdisciplinary science 
				with multiple approaches, but advancements in machine learning and deep 
				learning are creating a paradigm shift in virtually every sector of the 
				tech industry. <br> AI is a computer system able to perform tasks that ordinarily require 
				human intelligence... Many of these artificial intelligence systems are 
				powered by machine learning, some of them are powered by deep learning and
				some of them are powered by very boring things like rules.

			<h1 class='info-heading'> Types of Artificial Intelligence </h1> 
			<p class='info-content'>
				Artificial intelligence generally falls under two broad categories:<br>
				<ul class='info-list'>
					<li style='font-weight:bold'> Narrow AI : </li> 
					<p> Sometimes referred to as "Weak AI," this kind of artificial intelligence 
						 operates within a limited context and is a simulation of human intelligence. 
						 Narrow AI is often focused on performing a single task extremely 
						 well and while these machines may seem intelligent, they are 
						 operating under far more constraints and limitations than even the 
						 most basic human intelligence.
					</p>
					
					<li style='font-weight:bold'> Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) : </li> 
					<p> AGI, sometimes referred to 
							as "Strong AI," is the kind of artificial intelligence we see in 
							the movies, like the robots from Westworld or Data from Star Trek: 
							The Next Generation. AGI is a machine with general intelligence and, 
							much like a human being, it can apply that intelligence to solve any 
							problem. 
					</p>
				</ul>

			<h1 class='info-heading'> Some examples of AI </h1> 
			<p class='info-content'>
				<ul class='info-list'>
					<li> Smart assistants (like Siri and Alexa) </li>
					<li>	Disease mapping and prediction tools </li>
					<li>	Manufacturing and drone robots </li>
					<li>	Optimized, personalized healthcare treatment recommendations </li>
					<li>	Conversational bots for marketing and customer service </li>
					<li>	Robo-advisors for stock trading </li>
					<li>	Spam filters on email </li>
					<li>	Social media monitoring tools for dangerous content or false news </li>
					<li>	Song or TV show recommendations from Spotify and Netflix </li>

				Much of Narrow AI is powered by breakthroughs in machine learning and 
				deep learning. Understanding the difference between artificial intelligence, 
				machine learning and deep learning can be confusing. Venture capitalist 
				Frank Chen provides a good overview of how to distinguish between them, 
				noting:

			<p id='quotes'>
				"Artificial intelligence is a set of algorithms and intelligence to try to 
				mimic human intelligence. Machine learning is one of them, and deep learning 
				is one of those machine learning techniques."
