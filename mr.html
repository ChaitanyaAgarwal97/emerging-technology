			<h1 class='info-heading'> What is Mixed Reality? </h1> 
			<p class='info-content'>
				Mixed reality is a blend of physical and virtual worlds that includes both real 
				and computer-generated objects. The two worlds are "mixed" together to create a 
				realistic environment. A user can navigate this environment and interact with 
				both real and virtual objects.<br>Mixed reality (MR) combines aspects of virtual 
				reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR). It sometimes called "enhanced" AR since 
				it is similar to AR technology, but provides more physical interaction.

			<h1 class='info-heading'> Types of Mixed Reality? </h1> 
			<p class='info-content'>
				There are three main types of MR, namely:
				<ul class='info-list'>
					<li> Mixed Reality that only fuses layered digital objects into the real world. </li> 	
					<li> Mixed Reality that allows users to interact with holographic objects. </li> 
					<li> Mixed Reality incorporating the virtual environment that is connected to the real world and overlaps it. </li> 
				</ul>

			<h1 class='info-heading'> How does Mixed Reality works? </h1> 
			<p class='info-content'>
				To facilitate the process users often incorporate other elements into mixed 
				reality setups. These often include motion-tracking tech found in haptic gloves, 
				more streamlined exoskeletons, and controllers.

			<h1 class='info-heading'> Some examples of MR </h1> 
			<p class='info-content'>
				<ul class='info-list'>
					<li style='font-weight:bold'> Healthcare and medicine </li>
					<p> Mixed Reality simulations are already helping medical 
					students understand their patients better, particularly those who are hearing 
					and visually-impaired. Through MR technology, how these patients experience the 
					real world are simulated, leading to greater empathy and understanding from 
					medical practitioners.<br>Doctors—and surgeons, in particular— are able to 
					learn complicated surgeries and develop cutting-edge procedures. They can run 
					scenarios and simulate the same conditions in the operating room, allowing them 
					to plan and predict outcomes.
					</p>
					
					<li style='font-weight:bold'> Education </li>
					<p> Experimential education is one of the most effective 
					learning and teaching tools. Through Mixed Reality, students are able to interact 
					with what they’re learning unlike ever before. It’s not just visual, audio, or 
					traditional learning methods that will enable students to learn, but actual 
					experiences that promote deeper, immersive learning.
					</p>
					
					<li style='font-weight:bold'> Gaming </li>
					<p> There is great potential for Mixed Reality in gaming, 
					unlocking an experience that combines the intense and impressive worlds in video 
					games into the actual environment. It has the potential to gamify fitness, as 
					Augmented Reality had done as evidenced by the Pokemon Go phenomenon.<br>With 
					digital elements being embedded in the actual environment, people will be 
					motivated to physically move to access digital content and experience them 
					hands-free, instead of simply looking at screens on handheld devices.
					</p>
					
					<li style='font-weight:bold'> Retail and Business </li>
					<p> Many possibilities await businesses when they make 
					use of Mixed Reality technologies. Companies are now maximising VR and AR, like 
					providing augmented reality maps to customers for better understanding and access 
					to their stores.<br>With MR, stores can give customers unprecedented information 
					as they walk through the aisles, empowering customers to make informed and confident 
					purchases without the need for assistance. They can also experience a product 
					or a service before purchasing.
					</p>
